Because the time complexity depends on the number of inputs it has the complexity is linear which means that if you had
10 edges and vertices it would take a lot less steps than if you were to have 100000 of each.
This means that the run time of the algorithm increases at an order of magnitude proportional to v+e.
Therefore the time complexity is O(v+e)
--------PSUDO CODE --------
 if Start is the same as end there is a link
 make empty list
 the current vertex is the start vertex
 if the current vertex position has already been visited then there is a link

 while the queue isn't empty
 remove a vertex from the queue

 for each edge check if adjacent to destination
 check all points that have a charging station

 check if all the stations have been visited while finding a path to the destination
